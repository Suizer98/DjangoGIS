## Background of project
This project is created for: Grab GeoStars Program 2022 Geospatial Research Project.

It was held in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), organised by Grab, the biggest multinational technology company headquartered in One-north, Singapore.

## Topic
Visualising relationship between EVCSs and economic area using web GIS

## Aim
Aim: To study the geospatial distance relationship EVCSs and facilities in Malaysia for better installations

## Objectives
1. To build a more complete database for EV charging stations POIs.
2. Using web map to indicate the relationship between EV charging stations and economic areas showing proportional connection.
3. Lastly, using the visualization to analyse the where the next EV
 
## Outcome of project
What I implemented: A web map showing POIs and colour ramp heatmap deployed on free online server. With visualizations and patterns available, we can analyse our objectives more easily.

1. Simulated a likelihood live web GIS that can be helpful for research institutes or accessible by publics.
2. In general, EVCS still built near economic areas (more benefits). Relationship is there and not random occurrences.
3. Authorities can perform better urban planning by installing EV stations in prioritized areas (such as high-density area).
